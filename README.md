Useful extension methods for c# object types

I got this idea from the blog http://www.dotnetlines.com they have the credits for some extensions, I've also add some of them.

I decide to create this repository and build a nuget package to save time to other developers that could take advantage using this.

If anyone wants to collaborate and add another extensions method feel free to ask me for adding them to the repo and you will have the credits added in a mention in this file.
